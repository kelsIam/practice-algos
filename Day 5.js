//Merge two sorted linked lists
// Given pointers to the heads of two sorted linked lists, merge them into a single, sorted linked list. Either head pointer may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.
// Example: headA refers to 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> NULL
// headB refers to 1 --> 2 --> NULL
// The new list is 1 --> 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 7 --> NULL
// Complete the mergeLists function: it has the following parameters - singlyLinkedListNode pointer headA (a reference to the head of a list) and singlyLinkedListNode pointer headB (a reference to the head of a list). Returns the singlyLinkedListNode pointer (a reference to the head of the merged list). Input: The first line contains an interger t, the number of test cases - the first line contains an interger n, the length of the first linked list. The next n lines contain an integer each, the elements of the linked list. The next line contains an integer m, the length of the second linked list. The next m lines contain an integer each, the elements of the second linked list.
